## 📋 &nbsp;To-Do App

This is a Django Web Application that helps you maintain a To-Do. It can be used as a personal tracker to do things or for a wider range of people, as the application is multi-user and multi-group. Users can belong to several groups, and each group can have several to-do lists. At least one group (configured in the Django administrator) must be created before starting, and this group must have at least one user as a member.

Users can view and edit all to-do lists belonging to their groups. Only staff users can add or delete lists. All tasks are created by the current user and can be assigned to a specific user. Unassigned tasks are displayed as belonging to anyone.

### 📝 &nbsp;Requirements

- Django 2.0+
- Python 3.7+
